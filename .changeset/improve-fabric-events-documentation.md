Improved FabricEvents documentation with comprehensive JSDoc comments and corrected event names in READMEs. Each event now includes detailed descriptions, usage guidance, and property documentation. Fixed outdated event names and organized events into logical categories (Lifecycle, File Management, File Writing, File Processing) with examples showing how to listen to events.
